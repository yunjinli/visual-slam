## Visual Navigation

### Introduction

Most of the implementations are inspired by the framework provided by the course [Vision-based Navigation IN2106](https://vision.in.tum.de/teaching/ws2022/visnav_ws2022) from my university (TUM). In the course, we only finished visual odometry, and I would like to add a loop closure module to make it become a SLAM sytem.
